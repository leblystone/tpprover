/**
 * Firestore collection name constants — single source of truth for Cloud Functions.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS
 * --------------------
 * Several collections have names inherited from earlier features (notably Ghosty,
 * the AI support worker that was retired). The names in Firestore cannot be
 * changed without a full data migration, so we keep the original paths but expose
 * them here under clearer names. Any Cloud Function that touches Firestore should
 * import from here instead of hard-coding a string.
 *
 * MAPPING: code constant → actual Firestore collection path
 * ----------------------------------------------------------
 * USER_REPORTS_QUEUE  →  "ai_worker_logs"
 *   The admin User Reports inbox. One document per support ticket / feedback /
 *   deletion request that lands in the work queue. Originally written by the
 *   Ghosty AI worker; now written directly by these functions on every new
 *   submission regardless of Ghosty. The Firestore path is "ai_worker_logs" —
 *   there is intentionally NO collection named "userReportsQueue" in the console.

   * Firestore path: "ai_worker_logs"

   * The path is legacy (Ghosty era) — the collection was never renamed in Firestore.
